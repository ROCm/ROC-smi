### ROCm System Management Interface

This repository includes the rocm-smi tool. This tool exposes functionality for
clock and temperature management of your ROCm enabled system.

#### Installation

You may find rocm-smi at the following location after installing the rocm package:
```shell
/opt/rocm/bin/rocm-smi
```

Alternatively, you may clone this repository and run the tool directly.

#### Usage

For detailed and up to date usage information, we recommend consulting the help:
```shell
/opt/rocm/bin/rocm-smi -h
```

For convenience purposes, following is a quick excerpt:
```shell

usage: rocm-smi [-h] [-d DEVICE] [-i] [-t] [-c] [-g] [-f] [-p] [-P] [-o] [-l] [-s] [-a] [-r]

#### Detailed Option Descriptions

--setsclk/--setmclk # [# # ...]:
    This allows you to set a mask for the levels. For example, if a GPU has 8 clock levels,
    you can set a mask to use levels 0, 5, 6 and 7 with --setsclk 0 5 6 7 . This will only
    use the base level, and the top 3 clock levels. This will allow you to keep the GPU at
    base level when there is no GPU load, and the top 3 levels when the GPU load increases.

    NOTES:
        The clock levels will change dynamically based on GPU load based on the default
        Compute and Graphics profiles. The thresholds and delays for a custom mask cannot
        be controlled through the SMI tool

        This flag automatically sets the Performance Level to "manual" as the mask is not
        applied when the Performance level is set to auto

--setfan LEVEL:
    This sets the fan speed to a value ranging from 0 to 255 (not from 0-100%).

    NOTE: While the hardware is usually capable of overriding this value when required, it is
          recommended to not set the fan level lower than the default value for extended periods
          of time

--setperflevel LEVEL:
    This lets you use the pre-defined Performance Level values, which can include:
        auto (Automatically change PowerPlay values based on GPU workload)
        low (Keep PowerPlay values low, regardless of workload)
        high (Keep PowerPlay values high, regardless of workload)
        manual (Only use values defined by --setsclk and --setmclk)

--setoverdrive #:
    This sets the percentage above maximum for the max Performance Level.
    For example, --setoverdrive 20 will increase the top sclk level by 20%. If the maximum
    sclk level is 1000MHz, then --setoverdrive 20 will increase the maximum sclk to 1200MHz

    NOTES:
        This option can be used in conjunction with the --setsclk mask

        Operating the GPU outside of specifications can cause irreparable damage to your hardware
        Please observe the warning displayed when using this option

        This flag automatically sets the sclk to the highest level, as only the highest level is
        increased by the OverDrive value

--setprofile # # # # #:
    The Compute Profile accepts 5 parameters, which are (in order):
        Minimum SCLK       - Minimum GPU clock speed in MHz
        Minimum MCLK       - Minimum GPU Memory clock speed in MHz
        Activity threshold - Workload required before clock levels change (%)
        Hysteresis Up      - Delay before clock level is increased in milliseconds
        Hysteresis Down    - Delay before clock level is decresed in milliseconds

    NOTES:
        When a compute queue is detected, these values will be automatically applied to the system

        Compute Power Profiles are only applied when the Performance Level is set to "auto"
        so using this flag will automatically set the performance level to "auto"


#### Testing changes

After making changes to the SMI, run the test script to ensure that all functionality
remains intact before uploading the patch. This can be done using:
```shell
./test-rocm-smi.sh /opt/rocm/bin/rocm-smi
```

The test can run all flags for the SMI, or specific flags can be tested with the -s option.

Any new functionality added to the SMI should have a corresponding test added to the test script.
